    <h4>Biggest Inspiration</h4>

    <div class="about-content">
        <img src="imgs/Erron.png" alt="Erron">
        <p class="aboutP">Erron Chandler, 28 year old artist, whom is my God Brother, inspired me to 
            dive into the artistic field. His journey reminded me of mines when I first started. 
            He stated, “I spent a lot of time with colored pencils. Being very bored at work 
            opened my imagination, which prepared me for the next step.I got a paint set for secret
            Santa at work and that started my painting career. When I started painting, 
            I came up with the name “Fill Your Void” 
            because that what it felt like what I was doing for myself; filling in that negative
            space with creativity.”-Erron Chandler
