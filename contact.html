    <p class="Journey">I began my artistic journey during the Covid-19 lockdown, 
        when I found myself confined to a room with nothing but time and a restless mind. 
        To break the monotony, I picked up a notebook and started sketching—just simple 
        lines at first, but soon it became a daily habit. 
        That creative spark led me to experiment with painting on canvas, 
        exploring color, texture, and expression. Over time, my passion evolved,
         and I transitioned into the world of digital design, where I continue to 
         grow and create today. Art and design became more than just a way to pass the 
         time—it turned into a passion and a powerful form of self-expression. 
         What started as a creative escape during isolation has grown into 
         a meaningful journey, shaping both my skills and identity as an artist.</p>
